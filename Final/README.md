# Final
### Data Files:  Classes.csv
### Suggested UDTs:  Student, ClassRoom, School
### Description:
Read the Classes.csv file.  For each Student in the classes, assign the Student into a ClassRoom.  The number of Class's is unknown when the program starts but there is no limit to the number of ClassRooms in the School.  Assign each student to the appropriate ClassRoom.  Demonstrate that the Students are stored correctly to each ClassRoom in the School.
Note:  This is a similar architecture to the midterm.  The motel had rooms and guests in each room.  In the final, the school has rooms and the rooms have a collection (lists or dictionaries) of students.
